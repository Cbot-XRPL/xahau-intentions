        <h3 class="sub">UNL</h3>
        <p class="text1">I would like to join the UNL with our validator. I will give a bit of reasoning on how I got to
            this point. I started a corporation called Cbot Labs a few years ago. The purpose of the corporation is to
            research the XRPL, provide infrastructure to the xrpl, and create products on the XRPL. Since I started Cbot
            Labs we have created various things such as discord bots, airdrop tools, NFT projects, and NFT minting
            sites. By running a validator we will be reaching part of core goals to become part of the infrastructure
            for a facet of the XRPL. I'm passionate about learning and being involved in the XRPL. My consistent
            involvement in the community over the course of a few years is a good example of my continued commitment and
            future reliability as a validator. I intend to experiment with hooks and work toward creating products on
            the XRPL via Xahau .I own a construction and real estate business as part of my primary profession. I think
            Xahau is the perfect area to work on new use cases and products. These use cases and products can
            potentially improve legacy systems including but not limited to systems in my primary profession. Running a
            validator will help secure our potential future products and services on the network.

        <h3 class="sub">TABLE</h3>
        <p class="text1">I would like to join or create a table on Xahau. I have been working with gadget78 (mick) in
            the hopes of creating or being a part of the Xahau table. This table would also seat a few other
            individuals. My main motivation for wanting to join or create a table is to have a hand in management and
            expansion of the network. I find the planned structure for Xahau fascinating and am interested in getting
            involved. I believe myself and other table members can help spread knowledge about Xahau, explore new use
            cases, and discover possibilities with the new sidechain.</p>
