        <p class="text1">We are excited to announce that we have been added to the Xahau UNL. Our goal is to provide steadfast support to the network with our validator. We will continue to build on our self-hosted data center to improve the quality of our validator service. In the near future, we will be hosting a secondary validator for testing purposes.

        <h3 class="sub">CREATING OR JOINING A TABLE</h3>
        <p class="text1">I am interested in joining or creating a table on Xahau. My main motivation for wanting to join
            or create a table is to have a hand in management and expansion of Xahau. I find the planned structure for
            Xahau fascinating and am interested in getting involved. I have been working with gadget78 (Mick) with the
            intention of creating or joining a Xahau table. This table would also seat a few other individuals. We plan
            to ensure all table members have some technical knowledge about the XRPL and are active in the community for
            a reasonable amount of time. Our table would focus on research and development of new products and services
            to enhance the Xahau community. We plan to learn, build, and educate the community. I believe myself and
            other table members can help spread knowledge about Xahau, explore new use cases, and discover possibilities
            with the new sidechain. If someone can contact me with requirements or steps I need to take to set up or join a table
            that would be appreciated.
