        <h3 class="sub">JOINING THE UNL</h3>
        <p class="text1">I am interested in joining the Xahau UNL with our validator. Our validator is hosted in a home
            lab set up not using any cloud hosting. We have a backup machine to activate if needed to reduce downtime
            during service or in the event of a server failure. I will give some backstory on my interest in joining
            UNL. I started a business called Cbot Labs in 2022 to build on the XRPL. The purpose of this business is to
            research the XRPL, provide infrastructure to the XRPL, and create products on the XRPL. Since I started Cbot
            Labs we have created various things such as XRPL tools, discord bots, NFT projects, and NFT minting sites.
            By running a validator on the UNL we will be reaching a core goal to become part of the infrastructure for a
            facet of the XRPL.

            My involvement in the community over the course of a few years is a good example of my continued commitment
            and future reliability as a UNL validator. I intend to experiment with hooks and work toward creating new
            products on Xahau. Outside of the crypto space I work in real estate and construction. I look forward to
            finding ways to improve legacy systems in my primary profession via Xahau. I believe Xahau is the perfect
            area to work on new use cases and products. Running a validator on the UNL will help secure the future of a
            space I am passionate about.

        <h3 class="sub">CREATING OR JOINING A TABLE</h3>
        <p class="text1">I am interested in joining or creating a table on Xahau. My main motivation for wanting to join
            or create a table is to have a hand in management and expansion of Xahau. I find the planned structure for
            Xahau fascinating and am interested in getting involved. I have been working with gadget78 (Mick) with the
            intention of creating or joining a Xahau table. This table would also seat a few other individuals. We plan
            to ensure all table members have some technical knowledge about the XRPL and are active in the community for
            a reasonable amount of time. Our table would focus on research and development of new products and services
            to enhance the Xahau community. We plan to learn, build, and educate the community. I believe myself and
            other table members can help spread knowledge about Xahau, explore new use cases, and discover possibilities
            with the new sidechain.
